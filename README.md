Welcome to the digital toolbox of the DCD Lab. We assemble here the tools and documentation of our research on Data-Centric Design.

To learn more about the Data-Centric Design Lab, have a look at our [website](https://delftdesignlabs.org/dcd-lab/). You can join our Data+Design community on MS Teams by clicking on the MS Teams button below (TU Delft only) or emailing us at [lab@datacentricdesign.org](mailto:lab@datacentricdesign.org).

# What's there?

We envision a Data-Centric Design workflow as follows. You acquire data through a (web or mobile) App from data donation, crowdsourcing or landing pages; you collect data by prototyping an Arduino, Rasberry Pi or custom-based device that you land to participants; or you directly upload data from files. Then, you explore the harvested time series with a generic tool such as Grafana. You can export the data to use it in your preferred data tool at all times. Finally, you customise a (web or mobile) App to explore and annotate with participants.

In this context, a **Things** facilitates the prototyping of live data prototypes. An **Apps** facilitates the prototyping of web and mobile data explorers, customised for the appropriate insights and reflections tasks. Data is strongly typed to facilitate transfer and automate processing. But you can create your types (e.g. data structures) adapted to your need. Data is locked by default in its Things, only accessible by its owner. You grant and revoke access to your data at your convenience. You can read more about the concepts in the [terminology](https://dcdlab.org/explanations).

# How to contribute?

All the code we produce is open-source, we detail them in our [background info](https://dcdlab.org/explanations#oss). You can use our digital tools via this web platform or deploy your own. We welcome all contributions from feedback to suggestions and code contributions (via MS Teams, GitHub issue or email).
