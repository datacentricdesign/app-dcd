## Getting started

Note: local deployment will only work through 'localhost'; any other domain will fail to authenticate.
It means that you cannot use this deployment for external devices like phone or Arduino.

### Deployment with Docker Compose

To run the DCD app locally with docker-compose:

1. Copy development.env in .env
2. Run docker-compose

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You can access the app on [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

To look at the latest logs (tail for online the last x lines, f for listening to incoming logs):

```sh
docker logs app-dcd --tail=1000 -f
```
