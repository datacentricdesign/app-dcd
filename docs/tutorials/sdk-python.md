# Interacting with Bucket in Python

*Requirements: Python 3*

## Create a Thing

To interact with Bucket, the first step is to visit Bucket to create an account and a Thing.

During this process you will get the ID of your Thing (starting with dcd:things:…) and you will generate a public/private key.

These 2 pieces of information are needed for your Python code to interact with Bucket.

### Setup a Python project

Create a folder for your project and open it with VisualStudio Code.

To avoid disturbing other Python setup on your machine, we setup a virtual environment with virtualenv. To create a virtual environment called venv, open the terminal (VisualStudio Code, directly in your project) and execute the following command:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

Then we activate this environment with source:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

If it worked properly, you should see (venv) appearing on the left side of the line in the Terminal.

We can now install the DCD SDK library

```bash
pip install dcd-sdk
```

At this stage you can be prompted to update your pip module, you can do so with:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Your Python setup is now ready.

## Basic example

In this example, we will create a property `Accelerometer` generating random values. It shows how to establish a connection with Bucket using your Thing id and your private key. This is a typical case for a Python code running on a device to collect data.

In the file explorer (left-side panel), create a new file example.py and add the following lines.

```python
 # Import Thing from the Data-Centric Design
 from dcd.bucket.thing import Thing

 # Create an instance of Thing
 # (Replace with your thing id and the path to your private key)
 my_thing = Thing(thing_id="dcd:things:7f7fe4c6-45e9-42d2-86e2-a6794e386108",
                 private_key_path="/path/to/private.pem")
```

You can run this example in the terminal:

```bash
python example.py
```

To stop the program, press CTRL+C.

Once the connection is established with your Thing, we can get an overview of this Thing by printing the output of the method to_json(). Add the following line at the bottom of the file and run the program again. If you just registered your Thing on Bucket, it has only an id, a name and a type.

```python
print(my_thing.describe())
```

Let’s create a property ‘My Python accelerometer’. The method find_or_create() looks for an existing property with this name. If none is found, it creates a new on with the type ‘ACCELEROMETER’

```python
my_property = my_thing.find_or_create_property(
    "My Python Accelerometer", "ACCELEROMETER")
```

Let’s have a look at the property, it should contain the name and a unique id. The type also contains the dimensions, 3 in the case of an accelerometer.

```python
print(my_property.describe())
```

We are ready to send data. In the code below we create a function that generates an array with 3 random values and add them to the property. We then make an infinite loop (while True) to send these random values every 2 seconds.

To generate random numbers we need the library random and to wait 2 seconds we need the library time. These are part of Python, we just import them at the top of the file.

```python
from random import random
import time
```

Then, we can write our function at the bottom of the file.

```python
 # Let's create a function that generate random values
 def generate_dum_property_values(the_property):
     # Define a tuple with the current time, and 3 random values
     values = (random(), random(), random())
     # Update the values of the property
     the_property.update_values(values)

 # Finally, we call our function to start generating dum values
 while True:
     generate_dum_property_values(my_property)
     # Have a 2-second break
     time.sleep(2)
```

## Environment Variables

To avoid credentials in your code, the DCD Python Kit is looking for your thing id and private key from the environment variables. To set these variables, create a file .env and add the following lines (replace the thing id and the path by yours).

```bash
THING_ID=dcd:things:7f7fe4c6-45e9-42d2-86e2-a6794e386108
PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/path/to/private.pem
```
